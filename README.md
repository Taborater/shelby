# Shelby

Simple framework for ML competitions with tabular data.
Shelby mostly consists of [Scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) custom transformers (using TransformerMixin)
and simple Python functions.

Inspired with this [article](https://habr.com/company/ods/blog/426227/).
